Q: What is the purpose of CPE?

A: CPE is designed to create prompts for recurring tasks. In a conversational process, CPE assists in generating a prompt tailored to your task. You will see output examples based on the text you provide, allowing you to refine your prompt accordingly. Ultimately, you'll have a prompt that can be applied to various text examples.
